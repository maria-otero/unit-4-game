# unit-4-game

Crystal Game:

It is a guess game made it during UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp (April to July 2018) as part of a homework.

There are 4 clickable crystals, each one have a value that is sumed into a user score every time the user click them. The player wins when his total score matches with a random number given by the computer, and the player loses if his score goes above the random number.
